ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'swagger_client'

api_instance = SwaggerClient::DefaultApi.new

apikey = "apikey_example" # String | API Key provided for your account, to identify you for API access. Make sure to keep this API key secret.

term = "Ban" # String | Search keyword that should represent the start of a word in a city or airport name.

opts = { 
  country: "US", # String | Identified a country based of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2#Current_codes\">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code</a>
  all_airports: false # BOOLEAN | Boolean to include or not all airports, no matter their traffic rank. False by default, to only display relevant airports.
}

begin
  #Airport Autocomplete - Find an IATA location code for flight search based on a city or airport name using the term parameter. By only using the country parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA location codes associated with a country. Both term and country parameters can be used together to filter the results accordingly. The API is fully JQuery-Autocomplete compatible to enable you to quickly build a drop-down list for your users to find the right airport easily.
  result = api_instance.airport_autocomplete(apikey, term, opts)
  p result
rescue SwaggerClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling DefaultApi->airport_autocomplete: #{e}"
end

```
