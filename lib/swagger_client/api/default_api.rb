    # Airport Autocomplete - Find an IATA location code for flight search based on a city or airport name using the term parameter. By only using the country parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA location codes associated with a country. Both term and country parameters can be used together to filter the results accordingly. The API is fully JQuery-Autocomplete compatible to enable you to quickly build a drop-down list for your users to find the right airport easily.
    # <p>Using the term parameter and given the start of any word in an airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code\">IATA code</a>, this API provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/\">JQuery UI Autocomplete</a> compatible format. <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/airport-autocomplete-template.html\">This sample implementation</a> using JQuery UI may help.

    # Flight Inspiration Search - Go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question \"Where can I go within a given travel budget?\"
    # <p>The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way and return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.</p>  <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv\">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>.

    # @option opts [String] :departure_date Range of dates between which the traveler could depart. Dates are specified in the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\&quot;&gt;ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt; yyyy-MM-dd date format. Ranges are inclusive and ranges of months will apply from the start to the end of the month. If just a single date is specified, only that date will be searched. By default, the date range starts today and applies up to 361 in the future is applied. Past dates are generally not supported, future dates should be in the next 361 days, although results start to become sparse after about 6 months in the future, as airlines may still be defining their schedules. The default is to search all future dates available. (default to 2017-08-16--2017-08-26)
    # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :one_way When set to true, the query will be for a single trip from the origin to the destination. When this parameter is not provided, or is set to false, the query is for a round trip from the origin to the destination and back again. (default to false)
    # @option opts [String] :duration The allowed duration or range of durations of the trip, in days. This parameter must not be set if the one-way parameter is set to true. (default to 1--15)
    # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :direct Limit the search to results that do not require the passenger to change plane? (default to false)
    # @option opts [String] :max_price Maximum price of trips to find in the result set, in the currency specified for this origin and destination pair in the cache contents spreadsheet. So, for example, if the origin is NYC, and the max price is 400, this means 400 USD. If the origin is PAR, and the max price is 400, this means 400 EUR. By default, no limit is applied
    # @option opts [String] :aggregation_mode Specifies the granularity of results to be found. DESTINATION is the default and finds one result per city. COUNTRY finds one result per country, DAY finds on result for every day in the date range, WEEK finds one result for every week in the date range. Note that specifying a small granularity but a large search scope may result in a huge output. For some very large outputs, the API may refuse to provide a result.

    # Flight Inspiration Search - Go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question \&quot;Where can I go within a given travel budget?\&quot;
    # &lt;p&gt;The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way and return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn&#39;t return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it&#39;s a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv\&quot;&gt;a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs&lt;/a&gt;.

    # <p>A fast Hotel shopping API to see which hotels are available in a given area, on a given day and displays their lowest prices. With this API you can find out the price of the cheapest daily rate for all hotels within a specified radius of a point.</p>  <p>This API allows you to quickly see the hotel locations in a region, and what prices in that area look like,  as well as the check-in and check-out dates, and get list of up to 140 properties (names, codes, image, amenities) with their locations and rates. Optional parameters such as currency and maximum rates, amenities or hotel chain codes are also available and can be used to narrow down the results. More optional parameters such as show_sold_out & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms. </p>  <p>The API is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the <a href=\"https://hotelsearchengine.amadeus.com/\">Amadeus Hotel Search Engine</a> application. Results are returned very quickly, response times are generally under 2s. Our cache has great global coverage and is constantly refreshed with the latest prices.</p>

    # YapQ Geosearch - Find landmarks and attractions near a given point.
    # Amadeus has partnered with &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;http://yapq.io/\&quot;&gt;YapQ&lt;/a&gt; to bring you point of interest APIs with the goal of offering you unbiased ratings of landmarks and tourist attractions. YapQ rates places according to their interest on social media and provides Wikipedia content and Geonames ID at a given location. &lt;br /&gt; YapQ&#39;s service indexes millions of points around the world, and provides content in 12 different languages. This allows you to ensure you catch the &lt;em&gt;must-see&lt;/em&gt; sights at a specific &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;http://yapq.io/cities.html\&quot;&gt;YapQ supported location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; Each point of interest comes with links to content, grading information, location and directions to help make discovering your destination easy and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This service is still under active development, and the response format may change without warning. We&#39;d be interested in your feedback - &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;mailto:sandbox@yapq.com\&quot;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt;.
